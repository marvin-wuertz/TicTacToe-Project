# TicTacToe-Project
Tic-Tac-Toe or Three Wins is a classic, simple two-person strategy game

# Getting Started
On a 3Ã—3 square playing field, the two players alternately place their character (one player's cross, the other circle) in a free field. The player who can first place three characters in a row, column or diagonal wins. However, if both players play optimally, no one can win and there is a tie. This means that all nine squares are filled without a player being able to set the required characters in a row, column or diagonal.
